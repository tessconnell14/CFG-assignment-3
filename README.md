‚≠ê This is my third assignment for the CFG degree (Spring '23)

üìä I designed and built a database of the Great Walks in Aotearoa New Zealand using MySQL

üó∫Ô∏è I wrote queries for:
- walks that take an hour or under to drive to from the closest town
- names of the walks and the regions they are in
- all South Island walks in ascending order by distance
- walks that cost under $20 per night to camp in summer and are under an hour drive away
- total number of walks per region
- average price of huts in NZD across all walks
- converting driving distance to town from mins to hours
- stored procedure for increasing campsite costs by %
